        <p className='mb-6'>
          At <strong>LI-AS Construction Consulting</strong>, our vision is to
          empower businesses, institutions, and service providers with expert
          consulting services that transform ideas into functional, sustainable,
          and high-performing commercial properties.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-6'>
          We believe every construction project should begin with a clear
          strategy, precise planning, and expert guidance. From feasibility
          studies and cost management to quality control and project delivery,
          our commitment is to help our clients build spaces that drive business
          success and serve communities effectively.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-6'>
          Our team of professionals brings years of experience in commercial,
          institutional, and service infrastructure projects. We collaborate
          closely with clients to understand their operational needs, regulatory
          requirements, and long-term goalsâ€”ensuring that every project is
          delivered with excellence, on time, and within budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, we build more than structures; we build environments that
          support business growth, community development, and lasting impact.
